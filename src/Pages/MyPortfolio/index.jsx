          <h2>The reason for this post.</h2>
          <p>
            The birth of this idea is very interesting, it all stems from the
            problem of not having previously worked in a company or for someone
            or not having personal projects finished or planned. This problem
            could condition the complete design of my portfolio, because before
            it had a good number of sections that only added more work and
            maintenance to the project.

          <p>
            Of course, this idea was born to avoid that, the problem of trying
            to fill my personal work page with content that the users who may be
            my future clients are not interested in, of course you can also take
            this idea if you need a bit of extra content of what you do, no
            problem =).

          <h2>A somewhat peculiar first impression.</h2>
          <p>
            From the beginning I always wanted to implement something in the
            design that highlights and makes my portfolio different from the
            others.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started out drawing and making my own multimedia, but I'm still
            not good enough to do something decent and I also don't have a full
            bag to hire an artist, so I took the path of using the splashart of
            certain video game characters that I like to play and thus solve
            that problem until you can make or send to make the multimedia.
          </p>
          <h3>Let's talk about Home.</h3>
          <p>
            Starting with the spice, we have the home that is literally the only
            strong point if you talk about design, of course ignoring the code
            behind it.
          </p>

              Alguna ves la pagina tuvo varias secciones, pero se fueron
              descartando con el tiempo, hasta quedar projects. Es muy probable
              que la pagina dopte un diseño similar, pero en 3D
            </span>
          </div> */}
          <p>
            As we can see, if you are a web designer you can see that the Home
            is really working to have as little content as possible and is
            "expandable", when I write "expandable" I mean that it has the
            ability to show more future sections if necessary.

              Lo intente varias veces, pero no pude lograr llenar la sección
              como queria por la falta de información, no digo que sea
              imposible, pero el diseño de mi portfolio no permitia eso con
              facilidad
            </span>

          <p>
            Sure, but if you want to travel from one place to another, you would
            need to return completely to home and that is not entirely optimal,
            and here the menu comes into play, of course, until there is an
            extra section, the sense of making the browser in the The menu is
            null, so in its first version I reserve not to apply it and wait
            when it lists the next section that I suppose will be in early 2022
            and the menu will have a much greater utility.
          </p>
          <h3>The way to present the content</h3>
          <p>
            This is the part that I personally find most difficult because not
            having content does not give me a clear image of what to show, but
            luckily I spent some time preparing information articles so I
            already had an idea of ​​what it is. the best way to show it.
          </p>
          <h3>Displaying project posts</h3>
          <p>
            I have to admit that this is the easiest part of the job, but it has
            a lot of science behind it, but from the previous designs I already
            knew how to solve it.

              Todo esto comienza en el 2019, aunque suene raro, la comence a
              usar como plantilla hasta que llego a produccion :v porque se me
              ocurrio que seria muy original usarla porque nadie mas lo hace.

          <p>
            As we can see, the division is quite simple in order to show
            important information in the smallest possible space, in this case:
            title, cover image and if the work is personal or of a client.

              pero se que te las tengo guardadas, pero siempre tome a Ahri en
              cuenta para este proyecto porque ha sido gran parte de mi
              motivacion para seguir trabajando.

          <p>
            By having a minimalist design, it can be duplicated several times
            without problems, although in this part I need to finish the
            background, it really has a fairly correct result without it,
            obviously the problem with not having it is that it looks a bit
            empty without not enough projects.
          </p>
          <h3>Showing the content of the projects =)</h3>
          <p>
            Almost finishing the post of the first version of the portfolio, I
            have to admit that the part that is most difficult for me to design
            is the way to show the content of a post, personally I think that I
            have not yet reached the point of making my text looks especially
            good, but I think I've managed to do something passable
          </p>
          <PlaceHolderImage
            srcPC="https://i.ibb.co/b2T3Q97/example-text.jpg"
            srcMB="https://i.ibb.co/b2T3Q97/example-text-MB.jpg"
            alt="bruh"
          />
          <p>
            Try to make the text as less generic as possible, but having this
            little problem of not being used to working with it does not
            convince me of the result, luckily on the internet there are guides
            to have a text that does not overwhelm the user who reads it.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            By not convincing myself the result is likely to end up changing.
          </p>
          <h2>The future of the portfolio</h2>
          <p>
            It would be a lie if I say that the project is finished and would
            leave much to be desired, but the harsh reality is that my portfolio
            has a long way to go, from one more section to the implementation of
            3D objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Something is clear, I don't know when I'm done with this, maybe I'll
            never finish it, or maybe I'll get bored with it and start it over
            with a completely different design.
          </p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            To start in the industry, the magnificent idea of ​​using your own
            portfolio as your first project seems to me to meet the expectations
            of the market ... clearly this works well in the short term, but in
            the long run you will have to do more personal projects because it
            is not an eternal solution
          </p>
          <p>
            I know, the conclusion has to do with my idea that I had, but I
            don't have a conclusion
